Example of a failing case with 9 minutes:
Valve AA has flow rate=0; tunnels lead to valves BB, DD
Valve BB has flow rate=1; tunnels lead to valves AA, CC
Valve CC has flow rate=10; tunnels lead to valves BB, DD
Valve DD has flow rate=2; tunnels lead to valves AA, CC

      CC (10)
    /    \
  BB (1)  DD (2)
    \    /
      AA

At each node, check each child. If the path improves the pre-existing state,
update the child's aggregate flow, minutes, and stored path, then add the child
to the unvisited set.

Then, remove node from the unvisited set.

Set the next current node to be the node in the unvisited set with 1) the
lowest minutes and 2) the lowest aggregate flow.

Initializing all nodes to Infinity minutes and -Infinity aggregate flow.

Current node is: AA
AA checks BB
AA's path improves BB's aggregate flow of -Infinity; updating BB to aggregate flow of 0 at 1 minutes.
